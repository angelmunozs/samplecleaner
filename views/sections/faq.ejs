		<h4 class="question">
			Do you delete data that has been uploaded to your server?
		</h4>

		<p class="answer">Yes, we do. Any audio file you upload to <script type="text/javascript">document.write(window.location.hostname)</script> is deleted after a period of 24 hours, as well as the clean version of your song.</p>

		<h4 class="question">
			What programming language do you use?
		</h4>

		<p class="answer">Our web server is developed with <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">nodejs</a>, and we use Python's <a href="http://www.scipy.org/" target="_blank">Scipy</a> for audio signal processing.</p>

		<h4 class="question">
			Why do you use a FFT size of 2048?
		</h4>

		<p class="answer">
			Because for that size, 1025 positive frequency bands are analyzed, a number that we consider accurate enough for noise reduction. A higher FFT size will unnecesarily increase computational cost and execution time, and a lower one, won't be enough for the analysis.

		<!-- <h4 class="question">
			Are the techinques used by Sample Cleaner academically grounded?
		</h4>

		<p class="answer">
			Yes, it is. Sample Cleaner was developed by a Telecom Engineering student at Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid.
